Hi, I'm Ria!
ðŸŽ“ Computer Science & Statistics student
ðŸ”­ Machine learning enthusiast, full-stack developer, and Break Through Tech AI Fellow @ MIT

I enjoy using machine learning, data analysis, and web development to build real-world projects that make an impact. Iâ€™m passionate about growing both technical and leadership skills â€” from tutoring computer science and leading the CS Club at Suffolk to building deep learning models and generative AI apps. Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on refining my ML skills, exploring deep learning, and creating projects that bridge data, design, and user experience. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning, collaborating, and hopefully join an internship where I can apply these skills to solve meaningful problems.

ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Predicting National Happiness
What I Did: Built a regression model to predict Life Ladder scores using the World Happiness Report data
Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Random Forest
Result: Achieved ~0.89 RÂ² by selecting top features, helping highlight which social and economic factors most impact happiness
